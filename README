The JF Programming Language
===========================

A programming language built from scratch with modern semantics hopefully.
The two letters come from my and my gf's names respectively :) jf has a
runtime that is also called the stack-based VM and it looks like as follows:

+-------------------------------------+
|            runtime (heap)           |
| +---------+ +---------+ +---------+ |
| | context | | context | | context | |
| | (stack) | | (stack) | | (stack) | |
| +---------+ +---------+ +---------+ |
+-------------------------------------+

Each runtime has more than one contexts and each context has its own stack
for function calls and local variables. The runtime also maintains a global
heap space for objects allocated out of stacks and does garbage collection.

Contexts are scheduled by the runtime to execute bytecodes concurrently.
